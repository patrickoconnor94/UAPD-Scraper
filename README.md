# UAPD-Scraper
A python project (my first) to scrape case data from UAPD and make it more publically available. Out puts a csv with everything avaliable per case from UAPD's website.

##Future Goals
* Automatic Geocoding
* Date and Time cleanup 
* GUI for desktop
* Server edition for a constantly updated database
